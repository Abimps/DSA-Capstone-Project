## Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project

### Project Overview

I worked on two case studies by carrying out a comprehensive Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) using the appropriate analytical tools and techniques relevant to the
context of each dataset.

### Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis 

My team was tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can
guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement for a company on Amazon platform.

### Data source

The primary source of dataset contained information scraped from Amazon product pages, including:

• Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings

• Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content

• Each row represented a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values.
Total Records: 1,465 rows
TotalFields: 16 columns
